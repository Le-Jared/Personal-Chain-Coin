# PersonalChainCoin: Advanced Digital Asset Management on the Blockchain

PersonalChainCoin is a comprehensive blockchain-based solution for managing, tokenizing, and trading personal digital assets. It combines the power of ERC20 tokens with advanced asset management features, providing a flexible and secure platform for users to digitize, fractionalize, and monetize their assets.

## Features

- **ERC20 Token**: PersonalChainCoin (PCC) serves as the native token for the ecosystem.
- **Digital Asset Creation**: Users can create digital representations of their personal assets.
- **Asset Tokenization**: Convert assets into tradable tokens.
- **Asset Fractionalization**: Split asset ownership into smaller, tradable units.
- **Asset Bundling**: Group multiple assets into a single tradable bundle.
- **Auction System**: Host auctions for assets or asset bundles.
- **Rental System**: Rent out assets for a specified duration.
- **Collateralization**: Use assets as collateral.
- **Metadata Management**: Attach and manage detailed metadata for each asset.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for various functions.

## Smart Contracts

The project consists of two main smart contracts:

1. `PersonalChainCoin.sol`: The main contract that inherits from ERC20 and integrates with AssetManagement.
2. `AssetManagement.sol`: Handles all asset-related functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or later)
- Truffle Suite
- Ganache (for local blockchain)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalchaincoin.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd personalchaincoin
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to local network:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

## Usage

Here are some example interactions with the PersonalChainCoin contract:

```javascript
const PersonalChainCoin = artifacts.require("PersonalChainCoin");

// Deploy PersonalChainCoin
const pcc = await PersonalChainCoin.new(1000000); 

// Create a new asset
await pcc.createAsset("Vintage Guitar", web3.utils.toWei("1000"), "1969 Fender Stratocaster", "https://example.com/guitar.jpg", "Musical Instruments", ["vintage", "guitar"]);

// Tokenize an asset
await pcc.tokenizeAsset(1, web3.utils.toWei("500")); 

// Create an auction
await pcc.createAuction(1, web3.utils.toWei("800"), 86400); 

// Place a bid
await pcc.placeBid(1, { value: web3.utils.toWei("850") }); 

// Create a rental
await pcc.createRental(1, 604800, web3.utils.toWei("50")); 
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```
truffle test
```

## Security

This project uses OpenZeppelin contracts which have been thoroughly tested and audited. However, as with any smart contract project, it's crucial to conduct a professional audit before deploying to mainnet.
